"""Real-time terrain streaming — CPU patches generated in a worker *process*.

World-aligned terrain patches tile the ground ahead of a forward-flying camera.
Each patch is built in a separate process via `engine.submit_process` and swapped
into a fixed pool of recycled mesh slots (`handle.set_geometry`) when ready.

A separate *process* (not a thread) is essential: a patch takes ~1 s of numpy,
which holds the GIL through its Python-level parts and would freeze the render
thread for ~0.9 s. A process shares no GIL, so the render loop never stalls; the
patch's arrays ship back over IPC in a couple of milliseconds. (Because it uses
a spawn-context process pool, all engine/GPU setup lives under
`if __name__ == "__main__":`, and the patch builder is a top-level pure function
the worker can import cleanly.)
