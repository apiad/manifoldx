"""Two screens in one window: one Engine, one run(), screens swap inside it.

Each screen is a coroutine: it spawns its entities, panels and systems, waits
frames until Space is pressed, then tears down with clear_scene() and
remove_system(). quit() would close the window, so it is not used to switch.
